This project demonstrates the use of the Xilinx bare-metal SPI drivers under Ubuntu linux.

A hardware project for the MicroZed board is provided.  A simple user-side driver is provided as an example.

The files needed to set up Ubuntu on the MicroZed are very large so they are not provided here.  Many other sites provide that info.
